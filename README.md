## Introduction
This repository is designed to provide an overview of Raja Shereep M's academic background, skills, and interests. It includes a portfolio built with HTML to showcase his projects, along with documents that detail his hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure.

## Azure Fundamentals Course
This section includes documents and examples related to the completion of the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

### 1. Creating a Virtual Machine (VM)
This project demonstrates the creation of a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure. The VM is configured with specific parameters such as size, OS, and networking settings. It is a critical step for deploying applications and managing services in a cloud environment.

### Steps:
- Create a new resource group.
- Navigate to the "Virtual Machines" section in Azure.
- Set up a VM with the desired OS and configurations.
- Configure networking and storage options.
- Deploy the VM and verify its status.
  
### 2. Deploying a Git Repository
In this module, a Git repository is deployed within the Azure VM. This allows the repository to be managed directly from the VM, providing flexibility for development and testing.

### Steps:
- Access the VM via SSH or RDP.
- Install Git on the VM.
- Clone the repository from GitHub.
- Set up the necessary environment and dependencies.
- Run and test the application within the VM.
  
### 3. Creating a Storage Account (Blog Creation)
This project involves creating an Azure Storage Account and using Blob storage for managing large amounts of unstructured data. Blob storage is ideal for storing files, images, videos, and backups.

### Steps:
- Create a Storage Account in Azure.
- Navigate to the "Blob service" section.
- Create a container within the Blob service.
- Upload files or data to the Blob container.
- Configure access permissions and settings.
  
### 4. Creating a Static Web App
This module demonstrates the deployment of a Git repository using Azure Static Web Apps. This service provides a simple and cost-effective way to host static websites with integrated CI/CD from GitHub.

### Steps:
- Create a new Static Web App in Azure.
- Connect the GitHub repository to the Static Web App.
- Configure build and deployment settings.
- Deploy the web app and monitor its status.
- Access the deployed application through the provided URL.
